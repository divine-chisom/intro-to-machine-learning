### Author ID Accuracy
- Create and train a Naive Bayes classifier in naive_bayes/nb_author_id.py. Use it to make predictions for the test set. **What is the accuracy?**

```
No. of Chris training emails :  7936
No. of Sara training emails :  7884
Training Time: 2.067 s
Predicting Time: 0.194 s
0.9732650739476678
```

- Import, create, train and make predictions with the sklearn SVC classifier. When creating the classifier, use a linear kernel (if you forget this step, you will be unpleasantly surprised by how long the classifier takes to train). What is the accuracy of the classifier?
